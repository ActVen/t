        sferik: Any luck completing graphs this weekend? There have been lots of commits to RailsAdmin since summer ended but none from you. How's it going? (about 1 year ago)
        sferik: Not sure about the payment. Feel free to ask Leah or Yehuda directly. Think you'll be able to finish up your work on graphs this weekend? (about 1 year ago)

        sferik: How are the graph enhancements coming? (about 1 year ago)

        sferik: I'm trying to debug the issue you were having with the Bundler Gemfile.lock shortref. What version of Ruby and RubyGems are you running? (about 1 year ago)
